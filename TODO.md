### NOW
- Consider wrapping Live View access with hasNewLiveViewFrame() and getLiveViewSurface() like Capture

### LATER
- Test with multiple cameras
- Consider exposing explicit press/release shutter methods to allow for long exposures like in [kylemcdonald/ofxEdsdk#32](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxEdsdk/pull/32)
